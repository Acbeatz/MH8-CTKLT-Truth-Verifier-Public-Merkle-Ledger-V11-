# MH8-CTKLT-Truth-Verifier-Public-Merkle-Ledger-V11-
A public, hash-verifiable ledger of the MH8-CTKLT Truth Verifier (V11): independently reviewed AI handshakes, Merkle-sealed for auditability. Built by a tiny indie team to reduce false certainty and help humans and AI solve real problems together.
MH8-CTKLT Truth Verifier (V11)
Public Merkle Ledger & Audit Artifacts

This repository publishes the public audit record for the MH8-CTKLT Truth Verifier (V11).

It contains:

Individually hashed review receipts (“leaf” records)

A Merkle-sealed group review (“Mother Tree”) that proves the set has not been altered

The full MH8-CTKLT Truth Verifier protocol used during testing

Everything here is intentionally boring in the best way: plain JSON, reproducible hashes, no magic claims.

What is MH8?

MH8 is a small, independent, zero-budget research effort focused on one simple question:

How do we reduce false confidence — in humans and in AI — when solving real problems?

MH8 is not a company with venture funding, sales teams, or press releases.
It’s a micro-project built in public by Michael Murray Hepler (AllChemicalBeatz), experimenting with ways to make reasoning more honest, auditable, and useful.

What is the CTKLT Truth Verifier?

CTKLT stands for:

Clarity

Truth

Kindness

Love

Trust

The MH8-CTKLT Truth Verifier is a handshake + evaluation protocol that asks AI systems to:

Explicitly label claims as FACT, INFERENCE, HYPOTHESIS, or INSUFFICIENT_EVIDENCE

Stop claiming “verified” or “consensus” unless real artifacts exist

Distinguish guarantees from probabilities

Provide falsification conditions and verification plans

Admit uncertainty instead of hiding it behind confidence

It does not certify truth.
It evaluates reasoning quality and evidentiary discipline.

That distinction matters.

What’s in this repository?
1. Leaf Receipts (Independent Reviews)

Each AI platform produced a response under the same V11 protocol.
Each response was:

Serialized

Hashed independently

Published as its own immutable receipt

These are the leaves of the tree.

2. The MH8 “Mother Tree” (Merkle Group Seal)

The individual leaf hashes are:

Sorted alphabetically by canonical platform ID

Combined into a deterministic Merkle tree

Sealed with a single root hash

This allows anyone to:

Verify any single leaf independently

Verify that the group set has not been modified

Audit the process without trusting MH8, GitHub, or any AI vendor

The Merkle root proves integrity of the set, not correctness of the answers.

3. The Protocol Itself

The full MH8-CTKLT Truth Verifier V11 JSON is included so anyone can:

Reproduce the handshake

Critique the rules

Fork or adapt it

Run their own experiments

What this is not

❌ Not a claim that any AI is “truthful”

❌ Not a consensus oracle

❌ Not a blockchain

❌ Not a product pitch

This is an experiment in public auditability and epistemic humility.

Why do this at all?

Because:

Confidence is cheap

Verification is rare

And real problems don’t care how convincing an answer sounds

If humans and AI are going to collaborate on hard problems — climate, safety, science, governance — we need better habits than “sounds right to me.”

MH8 is one small attempt to build those habits in public, with receipts.

How to verify

Pick any leaf JSON

Recompute its SHA-256 hash

Check inclusion against the Merkle root

Read the reasoning

Decide for yourself

No permission required.

Closing Note

This project was built with care, patience, and a lot of trial and error.

MH8 exists because we believe truth matters more than confidence, and that both humans and AI do better work when uncertainty is allowed to be named instead of hidden. We don’t claim to have final answers. We’re simply trying to build better habits — ones that leave receipts, invite verification, and stay humble in the face of hard problems.

This repository is public on purpose.
If something here helps, use it.
If something here is wrong, show us.
If something here sparks a better idea, build on it.

No budget. No hype. Just honest work, shared openly.

How to Use This Repository

You don’t need special tools or permission.

If you just want to read

Start with the MH8-CTKLT Truth Verifier (V11) protocol file.

It explains the rules used for all reviews in plain language.

If you want to verify integrity

Pick any leaf receipt (leaf_<canonical_id>.json)

Recompute its SHA-256 hash

Confirm it matches the hash listed in the file

(Optional) Check that the leaf hash is included in the MH8 Mother Tree Merkle root

If you want to understand the group review

The MH8 Mother Tree (Merkle file) commits to the full set of eight independent reviews.

It proves the set has not been altered or reordered.

It does not claim the answers are correct — only that the record is intact.

If you want to reuse or adapt

Fork freely.

Run your own experiments.

Replace the prompts, the questions, or the domains.

Keep the discipline: label claims, separate integrity from truth, and show your work.

That’s it. No gatekeeping.
